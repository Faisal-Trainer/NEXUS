# Nexus Workflow

The Human-AI Nexus follows a 4-phase cyclical workflow designed to ensure maximum quality and traceability.

## 1. Audit Phase
The system (or specialized agents) scans the current state of the project.
- **Security Guardrails**: The engine will request explicit permission before scanning sensitive files (`.env`, `package.json`, `composer.json`).
- **Input**: Source code, documentation, and (if permitted) configuration files.
- **Output**: An Audit Report in `audit/`.
- **Goal**: Identify gaps, bugs, or opportunities for improvement.

## 2. Planning Phase
Based on the audit report, a detailed plan is generated.
- **Input**: Audit Report.
- **Output**: Implementation Plan in `documentation/planning/`.
- **Human Role**: Review and approve the plan.

## 3. Execution Phase
Specialized agents execute the tasks defined in the plan.
- **Input**: Approved Implementation Plan.
- **Action**: Code generation, configuration updates, or content creation.
- **Constraint**: Agents must follow the standards in `skill/`.

## 4. Finalization Phase
The results are recorded and the knowledge base is updated.
- **Input**: Execution results.
- **Output**: Logs in `memory/short_term/` and summaries in `documentation/summary/`.
- **Loop**: Trigger a new Audit to verify the changes.

### Zero Flaws Enforcement
The cycle repeats until an audit results in "Zero Flaws". This ensures that no technical debt or bugs are left behind.
